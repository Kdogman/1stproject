		<p> I really like Nyle. He just seems so nice and caring. He's artistic, shy, has the cutest laugh and smile I've ever seen in my entire life. And his eyes are beautiful, theyre like looking at a beautiful ocean on a misty day. I swear he's the type of person people write poems or songs and paint about. I've been trying to figure out if Nyle likes me back cus we always catch each other looking at each other. So I asked Andrew  if he could ask him if he had a crush on anyone. So I've been bugging Andrew if he could ask him if he has a crush on anyone. I've been bugging Andrew for about 3 days, and nothing yet. Well I guess Andrew got annoyed and said "You have been bugging non stop for 3 days about your crush who has never had a girlfriend before and that isn't really interested in relationships." And i was kinda sad? Idk, I really want to talk to him but i get so nervous. Ugh"

		<p> Nyle likes me back!!!!!!! Oh my gosh and he has even mentioned asking me out. And if it would be better in person. Reason for him saying to be in person or not is because of the coronaviruse. I HATE IT. It's really ruined   e v e r y t h i n g. Yeah sure that's because of the whole reason i found out whether Nyler likes me or not. But we had so much planed!! Because we made a band and we were both in it and we were going to meet up. Then we also talked about going on a group date with Beatrice and Fareed. But then of course we can't do that since (although it may not have even have worked out since Beatrice wants to break up with Fareed) we all have to be quarantined. So now I'm stuck at home and can't do anything with friends and it SUCKS. I finally find a fun group of people and friends and were doing stuff every week then the disease pandemic happened. Yeah so there's my stupid fucking day. Oh and worst of all, I think Nyle's loosing feelings for me and maybe I am too because it's hard tp have a relationship  relying purely over text. Ughhh. I hate everything.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>May 8. 2020</p>
		<p>Oh my gosh I miss Nyle so much. I almost think I love him. He's just so perfect and sweet and nice and kind and handome, and dreamy, and funny, and caring and just precious. How he'll make cookies with his mom and loves his bunny. How he'll make me feel so special and he's just precious. I used to not get when "opposites attract" but now I absolutely get it, it's like we're opposites but just perfect for eachother.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>May 14. 2020</p>
		<p>I stayed up all night last night, it's 7:53 right now, and I didn't sleep a wink and just watched You on Netflix all night. I'm laying here and just wondering my existance, why am I here. I don't get it. What's my purpose. Am I just here to live. Well then what's the point. What if we're just kinda like germs. We just come and go. When we die nothing really happens. Since religion is really just made so you feel less scared, and more scared about doing something wrong. I don't know how the whole thing with Nyle will work during quarantine. Like, idunno, I hate having to keep all of this by text. I would prefer not texting but when we see eachother, be together; Instead of what I know will happen, we'll do all this, then when we see eachother it'll be awkward. Well I know it's not like I can choose what will happen or whatever. It's just, I don't know. I kinda wish he was more exciting though. It's like, almost predictable with him, yet not at the same time. Like I'm doing all the heavy lifting or something. I guess it can be somewhat annoying, but I don't know. He'll grow out of it. Oh well. Im considering whether I should get up- nahh, obvious answer is to stay in bed because as soon as I get up I'll have zero phone time and have to talk which I don't feel like doing.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>June 10. 2020</p>
		<p>Everything just seems so pointless. And it honestly is. I just feel so dead like, nothing matters. I have no motivation, and like yeah I have stuff like Nyle, and living long enough to be a grandma, but like that doesn't help me from feeling this way. I've been quite annoyed with Sofia lately, she's really quite selfish. I feel so bad sometimes because of her, I just want to tell her she'd create a terrible orphanage because she can hardly be nice to me. But that's really harsh, but she has done some pretty harsh stuff as well to me. It's almost like I'm an addict, whenever just the slightest bit of kindness is given towards me, from her, I just get really clingy and keep coming back even when she treats me like shit. Any inconcenience that happens to her while I'm near, she'll take her anger out on me. Oh well, I've been blocking out pain lately too. Like, awhile back, I fell off the swing and hit my head. I was about to tear up and cry, but I didn't and I just layed there. Today I slipped and fell and hit my head on the corner leg of a chair. No tears. It's like I've turned my emotions off.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>March 14. 2020</p>
		<p>I can't get the thought of dying out of my mind. Everyday, all I can think about is how nice it would be to be dead. The time I love most is when I'm in bed at night, everything just fades away and it's like I don't even exist. It's all quiet and peaceful. It's very calming. It's the one time I can fully zone out of life and just be. I think that's what death would be like. I want to kill myself but I want to stay alive at the same time. I can't stop thinking about killing myself, slitting my wrists vertically, slicing my throat, laying in my blood, feeling the world fade away, jumping off and landing splat, feeling the wind against me as I fall. But I do want to live. I'll make a promise with myself, that's the deal, if I ever have a plan to kill myself, I'm running away, I want to live. I would write a note saying, I couldn't stop thinking about killing myseld, I wanted to do things, thus the reason why me running away was my only option. (an option to speak to you guys would end up with you guys crying and me saying sorry, huhhhh??? exactly) Today's the day Nyle and I said we liked each other. I don't feel sad I just feel meh. I wanted to say something, text him hi, but I just don't feel like it. Oooh I'm super excited I think my shoes are coming in tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but either way yayy.</p>
		<br>

		<p>March 29. 2020</p>
		<p>I think I'm really starting to like Ethan. The conversations we have are so fun, he really knows how to brighten the mood. When I had woken up from my sleep paralysis I was freaking out and he knew just what to say to make me laugh. There's something about him that's so comforting. He has these really nice eyes and he listens to some good music. God I can't stop thinking about him all day, but I guess I would that those are my favorite parts of my day. He's just so kind and sweet, I get a little concerned though because, it seems like he has some problems with his dad and emotions and eating. I want to be there for him. I would hope and think I understand him, I feel like we might be going through similar things, I'm not sure though. I wish we could talk about  deeper things though. I really want to know him. Ugh, he's just so amazing.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>"This bad mood, so easy to sustain"</p>
		<p>I can't get rid of this feeling, it's so addictive. I run further away each time only for it to scratch me in the back and get me again. I think I'm safe only to look over my shoulder and see it there again. But i welcome this feeling. It's a sick addiction for sure. I WANT to die. It's my choice. I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to die I want to die my mind is littered with this repulsive  yet sickly sweet thought. Everyday it haunts me. I invite this feeling because I'm in love with feeling how sick I am. It's a deadly feeling. I want to die. I need to die. I must die I want to die, nothing will stop me. I will die, I want to die. Why is there this lovely image of myself being sick and wanting to be torn up. Why, I wish to die.</p>

		<p>I saw Thorn in the hallways today. I couldn't help but think if she still thinks about me. She probably does, but she'll soon stop. That's how it's always been. No one has ever missed me like I have missed them and I'm not okay with that. It hurts even more because I've asked to be back with my exes and they've all said they've moved on. Why haven't I? Why can't I just stop thinking about them. I fell in love with them for who they are and the things they did, I'll never fall out of love, but I can grow to ignore my feelings. What is it that I do for them to never want to be with me again. What did I do? I don't think I'm really meant for anyone. No one's ever loved me like I've loved them. What's wrong with me. Why can't I just hate them. They've ruined me and messed up my future experiences because now all I can think about is them. I hate this. </p><p>I hate feeling, I hate living, I hate seeing, I hate breathing, I hate thinking, I hate wondering, I hate wishing, I hate sending, I hate hope. I hate being alive. I miss being loved.</p>

		<p>Janurary 24. 2022</p>
		<p>I can't bring myself to write my emotions down as I did before. Something has changed and i cant figure out what. Could I have grown? Just become numb to whats happening. For once I finally feel special, but when he's with his friends, it's like I don't know him anymore.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Feburary 1. 2022</p>
		<p>My first tear, in fear that he doesn't love me anymore. I have given him everything, and now I have eveything to lose. What is it with my thoughts that won't stay quiet. I'm terrified because if I can lose feelings in a day, what if he can too. Have I been forcing myself to lose feelings like that because I've been scared. Have I reduced myseld to nothingness because that's what I think others are? He said he would tell me if he's stoped loving me, right?</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>May 24. 2022</p>
		<p>I hate when I see a teacher I recognize out in public-I can't say hi because they won't know who I am. One year of hearing their jokes, yelling at kids, laughing cutting us slack.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>June 1. 2022</p>
		<p>He's too casual about everything, and I think I'm part of the problem "You can't respect someone who kisses your ass..." and that's exactly what I feel is happening. Maybe I show him too much of exactly how much I love him. It probably pushed him further and he just doesn't bother. I've tried telling him but he says "relationships should be easy". Everything is about himm is perfect except for the fact that he doesn't try. Maybe he does, but not in a way that I can tell. And maybe Nolan was right saying how he's lowered my expectations. I think that's the part I hate the most. I deserve more. God I hate this. I love him so much, but I want someone who wants me. I hurts knowing that that's not how it is. I've only ever been in unrequited relationships; and, the funny part is, I've had guys who are just obsessed and captivated by me, and I've turned them down. All to chase someone that does the minimum. Hadi was head over heels, but I didn't feel the same way- he treated me so well- he loved everything about me and made sure I knew. How he would compliment my hair, and my nose and my freckles. Things no one had really payed attention to, but he did. He always saved all the snaps I had sent him and always was saying how beautiful I was. Then there was Santana. All of our conversations were so meaningful. But I just didn't feel the same. he was [erfect and so funny. When I said we should stop talking, he texted me on everything he could, even getting a friend to message me for him. There are guys that would do anything for me, and apparently there are girls that would do anything for a guy- and I guess I'm one of them. This concludes my conclusion of Gavin maybe most probably just not being the one. I can't change him- he needs to want to change himself.</p>

		<p>Those thoughts never go away do they. Feeling pain is what makes me feel real. I feel something. Even for just a second, but it brings me bacl. I don't know from where exactly it brings me back from. It was such an addicting habit. I haven't self harmed since September 21, and I'm not going to , but I miss it. The constant urge to hurt myself has never left though.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>July  21. 2022</p>
		<p>How am I supposed to feel comfortable talking to them about things I want to change about my appearance. They keep on saying "you could've talked to us about the nose ring" but ever since I can remember they've always poked fun at how I looked. Always small remarks nevertheless. I just feel like I can't be myself. I can't like the things I like because they're different than what they like. "now you and Koda have matching collars" "maybe wearing a towel around your head is a new thing" the faces my mom puts when I wear an outfit I really like, or new shoes that I'm excited about. I don't let it show, but I feel like an outcast in my own family. "It's not stylish, it's just black, you could wear anything and it wouldn't make a difference because it's all black" why is it not okay to like the things I like. "you look sick, like you've never seen the sun" they don't even realize it but it wears me down. I didn't even know that that's why I don't talk to them. I was so scared to ask to dye my hair for the first time. I cried so much. It was such a mess to want to get my ear double pierced. How am I supposed to feel comfortable with asking them when my entire like they've always poked fun about how I look. Whether it's about my weight, my nose, my clothes, my height with shoes. And now here I am crying because everything clicked.</p>

		<p>August 8. 2022</p>
		<p>I just realized today that my life isn't a movie. Movies in real life don't exist.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>August 21. 2022</p>
		<p>It's getting bad again. Hopeless. I feel empty. I'm scared something bad will happen. Only saying that I'm scared because I know myself- when I was feeling better, I wouldn't want this for myself.</p>
		<br>	
		<br>
		<p>September 2. 2022</p>
		<p>I want to face a devastating tragedy so I can feel real</P>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>September 5. 2022</p>
		<p>I want my life to be a movie so fucking bad. Maybe that way Id at least know why my life's shit. But I'm never going to feel like I'm in a movie aren't I. I'll spend my life wishing I was. I don't mind. Maybe if I wasn't in love with dying.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>September 6. 2022</p>
		<p>The way he just stared at me, as I was gasping for my words. It's been a year sine I tried killing myself. Everyone has been taking it differently</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>September 9. 2022</p>
		<p>For the first time in awhile, my heart has returned. There's a boy in my class, and I can't help but blush whenever I look at him. I don't know what it is. Maybe the way he talks, how his eyes move, the outline of his nose, how friendly he is, his jokes. I get so nervous and can hardly think. I need to talk to him more.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>September 12.</p>
		<p>Why am I such a sucker for cheesy teen romcoms</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>September 13. 2022</p>
		<p>My heart flutters at every momentary glance I take towards Max.</p><p>It's staring to smell like fall</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>September 16. 2022</p>
		<p>I feel like I search everywhere for true feelings of love. I have so much to give. It's like i just want to be loved and give love but it's all pointless. I feel unwanted at the best of times. Habe I neglected the one person who might actually feel this way for me? Maybe it's just wishful thinking. I do really want to catch up with him, just hear his voice. I do miss him. I feel like thought, I give my heart to anyone who gives me the slightest bit of attention. I've never wanted to be more alone than now.</p><p> Why do I keep trying to talk to people and regret it immediately afterwards.</p><p> I like to get rid of things that mean a lot to me. For some reason I feel likes it's a good thing.</p><p>He never actually knew me. He only knew what he wanted to know.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>September 25. 2022</p>
		<p>God my heart feels so ripped and torn and empty, but I still want to give anything that's left away.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>September 27. 2022</p>
		<p>I wouldn't mind if it all ended today. I feel like there's a chunck of my heart missing. I truely have no ties or anything that makes me not want to leave. Of course there's family, friends and hobbies, but I just want nice and quiet peace forever. I'm just so tired, why does it still hurt when I see any old picture from when Nyle and I were together. He was the only guy that never hurt me, he only did that once we were done.</p><p>I do wonder what it would be like once I do leave. How soon would everyone know. Would they think back on all our times together. Would they recall tiny clues and hints I had left during my time here. Everything is just one big blur to the next. I'm losing control again.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>October 3. 2022</p>
		<p>I'm scared I will never truly be able to love anybody. But the funny thing is, I only realize how much I love them once I push them away. But none of them has ever tried to fully stay. And in my defense, I don't think anyone has ever truely loved me.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>October 24. 2022</p>
		<p>There's no use in trying to find words. Just simply a deep tight pain in my chest and I can't figure out where it's coming from. I feel hollow, but I constantly reach for more to fill this hollowness. Yet I push it aside so I can continue to feel this pain. These short spurts of emotion are the only thing reminding me that I am real. Even though I feel this way, I want to feel more. I want to feel cold and see the change. But it's been a year and I should be proud, right? The further I get I try to force myself to try harder. I don't know when I won't be able to try anymore.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Another</p>
		<p>My heart aches and twists at the sight of Franz Kafkas words. I've never felt so understood. It hurts so much.</p><p>I've never felt so suffocated and alone like I am right now. Reading all the notes I've written to myself, I have no idea who all these different boys are that I've talked about and yet, each one of them, you'd think I'd found my soul mate.</p><p>I was gasping for air, as if the phone in my hand was a gun. Why is it so hard to tell someone that it's getting bad again.</p>
		<br>

		<p>I don't think you're supposed to feel a connection to the characters that you relate to, I think if you truely relate you feel pity and a sick empathy.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>November 14. 2022</p>
		<p>I want to go back to him, just knowing that someone loves me would mean more to me than feeling like I'm loved. Is the only reason I put him on this pedestal because I ended things before I stopped liking him. That's why I think he's this perfect person and that I made a mistake.</p>

		<p>Not again, a new crush. Gray, he wears really muted cool toned clothes and I think it's so cute. I only have tomorrow left to do anything until thanksgiving break. Should I tell him how I feel? Should I wait until I know this is really how I feel? Do I actually like him? Am I just wanting something to distract myself? Hopeful wishing?</p>

		<p>December 13. 2022<p>
		<p>Have I ever fully gotten over someone I loved? I think im hoping for the day one dinally comes back to me and says that they love me still and that they never stopped. Maybe it's just my fear of being alone and desperately trying to always have someone. But still, if any of my past ex's were willing to change for me I'd take them back in a heartbeat. What I don't understand though, is that I've broken up with every single one of them, yet when I try to talk to them again, they never want me.<p>

		<p>Janurary 1. 2023<p>
		<p>I feel so utterly and completely tired. I am so tired of being a person, it's worn a hole in my chest. Everything's tainted with past memories. I feel broken. I've constantly been dreaming of my dream guy and finding the one:but reality hits me and everything feels off and I can't stand the thought of being intimate with another person. I just don't feel like I'm the same person I was. I think my heart healed poorly. I'm tired of communicating and feeling. I'm so tired of it all, but its like I can't dream of anything else.<p>
		<p>September 21<p>
		<p>I don't know why I was crying, it was something I wanted for so long, and there I was, just sobbing. I had stashed a knife away in my room for several months. But this idea had been in my mind for several years. Numb and mindlessly standing up from my desk, where my homework that was due tomorrow layed, I stood up and reached for the red kitchen knife I had hidden behind a painting in my room. I don't remember ever grabbing, the walk to the bathroom, or even going inside of it: but the lights were off, the door was locked and I was on the floor clutching a knife and trying to stop crying. At this point my tears turned into incoherent bawling. My mother yells from the kitchen "bless you", she was far and must've thought I was having a sneezing fit. I started to cut. But nothing happened. The blade was dull and I was still sobbing, At this point my mother panicked and I could hear her running to me and I began rushing. I was practically sawing at my wrist. I remember seeing a blue vein under something very transparent and I wasn't able to cut it. I started on the other wrist but the knife was too dull to actually do anything more than surface wounds. My mom was banging at the door at that point and almost instinctively I threw the knife from under the door and unlocked it. I can't quite remember what happened here either but I know I snapped. I'm not a violent person, and especially not in front of others. I had wanted to be dead so badly in the moment, yelling through my sobs and kicking the cabinet and pounding on the walls while my mother only watched, I felt only rage. My next memory is of me sitting on my floor collecting myself and turing off eny emotion I had left while my mom called 911 and police arrived moments latter. A woman and a man. I accepted the offer of the woman in which she would take me to the hospital. Everything after this point felt like my life was put on mute and I was only observing. I felt like a ghost. I wasn't supposed to be here. I remember very little of what was said to me at the time, but what was said to me is something I will never forget. I will learn to manage. The male police officer had told me that he lost his younger brother to suicide as wll, which is why he wanted to be put in this unit of the police force. He told me that nothing was ever the same and it never will be but you learn to manage. Sitting there, on the floor, I never would've thought I'd finally know what those words really meant.<p>

		<p>I feel like doodoo<p>
		<p>I think I'm frustrated that I don't feel anything from him. Like there hasn't been any effort. Which I do understandm because, what is there to try for. In his mind- she already like me, I kinda like her, I don't have to worry about anything- which is understandable, but just difficult for me.<p>

		<p>July 14. 2023<p>
		<p>It's been a while since I've truly written anything. Maybe it's because in my mind I've connected my writings as a sign that I'm not doing too great. And maybe that's true, because lately I haven't. And lately I've also been realizing that I'm not fit for a relationship, or for anyone really in that case. I try, but deep down, I'm selfish. I care too much fo what others think of me. I'm vain and heartless. Maybe giving my heart away always too easily and pretending im immune could've caused this. Made me callous. Yet here I am again blaming something else. I'm not sure why I think finding ture love would fix everything. I just want to be understood. And yet, I'm so tired of understanding others.<p>
